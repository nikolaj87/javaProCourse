                           Apologies for not meeting the deadline with my previous HT
        Hi Julia! I wanted to apologize for not meeting the deadline for my "tell me about yourself" task.
        I'm really eager to receive your feedback on it. That's why I'm sending you this email.

        You can find the "tell me about yourself" task in the attached document. I'm looking forward to hearing
        your response. See you on Friday! Bye!

        Best regards,

        =============Tell me about yourself===============

            My name is Nick, and I'm from Kiev. I'm happy to be here and incredibly interested in working for such
        a successful company like ABS. I believe I possess the talents and skills that the company is looking for.
            Although my first education is in a different field, I made the decision to complete a year-long course in
        Java Backend development. I have already acquired a significant amount of information and continue to study
        every day, which is truly impressive. This year has shown me that switching profession, particularly in light
        of recent world events and relocating to this city, was an excellent decision. And I can confidently say that
        I have found what I was looking for.
            My previous business experience, primarily as a self-employed individual in analytics and statistics,
        wonderfully aligns with the essential skills of a proficient programmer. I am confident that in the coming
        years, I will work as a backend developer and I hope to secure this position with your company.
            The project, which is attached to my resume, includes all the necessary technologies for creating
        bank programs. I am prepared to engage in discussions regarding technical issues related to the project.
        If you don't mind, I would be happy to get down to these topics and provide further details.
